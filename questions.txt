a. Why didn’t the original program forward packets between the hosts?
	the IP addresses were not able to ping each other because of r1's ip

b. Is the line ‘ r1.cmd('sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1') ’ required?
	yes

c. Intentionally break your working program, e.g.: change a subnet length, IP
address, or default route for a host. Explain why your change caused the
network to break.
	changing the IP address meant that the host were no longer part of the same subnet
